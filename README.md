### Acknowledgement
As with any piece of research that results in the production of this project, there should not be only the name of
the author for this project, but also the names of all those unsung heroes who provided assistance, encouragement
and guidance, in which without I would not have succeded.


I would like to thank [Jaclyn Tan](https://github.com/Jachokoreto) and [Jason](https://github.com/jasonkwm) for their
help and support throughout the process.

### Commands
You can compile the program with your own main.c with your own test cases by running `make test` in the repository.
